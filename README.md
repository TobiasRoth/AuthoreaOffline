# AuthoreaOffline
Compile Authorea documents offline and make them still look good online. 

## Hack idea
The people at Authorea are doing fun things with the way scientific documents are written and their integration with GitHub is good. One of the quirks for me, though, is having to work online. There have been attempts to bring the process offline but they break down as the articles get bigger, mostly because Authorea requires a strict repository organization. I would like to improve the Python script written by Erik Tollerud to build the documents offline and keep a working version online in Authorea. To make a working hack I think Python should be enough but any suggestion from someone who knows more LaTeX than I do can be useful.
